# Voynich Proto-Language Translation Framework

This project presents a structured, hypothetical proto-language model used to simulate coherent translations of the Voynich Manuscript across Herbal, Zodiac, Balneological, and Cosmological folios.

## Included
- `voynich_translation_paper.tex`: LaTeX paper documenting the method
- `voynich_morphology_diagram.png`: Visual explanation of glyph morphology

> Not a confirmed translation, but a functional, scalable system for decoding and testing linguistic hypotheses against Voynich text.
